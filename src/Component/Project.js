        The purpose of the project is that the customers enable their privacy and preference management so that they 
        could enable or disable their privacy settings. Here the project gave a fleixbility to opt-in or opt-out of 
        the preferences. The preferences that they enable or disable will get stored in the database and the marketing 
        team will not call or email the customers since they have made opt-out selected. This is been done as a part 
        of CCPA (California Consumer Protection Act). In this Project, I worked as a UI Developer and I have created 
        screens for the application where I have created screens for Opt-in and Opt-out. I used technology stack like 
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS and Redux(basic) for managing applications state. And I prepared Demo screens 
        for the opt-in and opt-out and opt-down from Figma tool and get it approved from the client.
